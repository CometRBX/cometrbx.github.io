# Adding Commands

Since Solar does not come with any commands by default, you'll need to make your own or add some community made commands to Solar.

Doing this is pretty easy, just follow the steps below and you should be good to go!

## Finding Commands

If you'd rather not make your own commands, you can find some in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AdjPbp3mRq) or on our [Community Commands](/community/commands) page

## Inserting Commands

Inserting commands is quite simple, all you need to do is drag the Roblox model into the viewport and then move it into the `Commands` folder

After you've done that, you can configure the commands if you'd like to!

## Creating Commands

You can view our tutorial on creating commands [here](/creating-commands)
